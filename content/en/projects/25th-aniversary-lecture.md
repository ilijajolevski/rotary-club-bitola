# 25 Years of Rotary Club Bitola: A Lecture on Rotarianism

Rotary Club Bitola marked its 25th anniversary with a special event at the Officer’s House, featuring a lecture titled “Rotarianism from the Beginning to Today.” The gathering brought together members of Rotary Bitola, alongside representatives from younger rotary clubs in the region. The event was opened by the club’s president, Vladimir Kosturski, who welcomed attendees and set the tone for an evening of reflection and inspiration.

The lecture was delivered by three distinguished speakers: Rade Hristovski, Prof. Dr. Konstantin Petkovski, and Prof. Dr. Igor Nedelkovski. Hristovski provided a global perspective, tracing Rotary’s origins back to 1905 when Paul Harris founded the organization in Chicago. Today, Rotary boasts 1.4 million members across more than 46,000 clubs worldwide, united by a commitment to community service. Petkovski then shared the local story, recounting how Rotary Club Bitola was established in 1999 with a small group of dedicated individuals. Early meetings were held at Hotel Bitola, with the first badges crafted at Hotel Molika, inspired by the example of Rotary Skopje.

Looking to the present and future, Nedelkovski highlighted modern trends in Rotary’s work, emphasizing the impact of the Rotary Foundation. He recalled early projects, such as a donation to a school in Demir Hisar, and urged younger members to think globally while acting locally. He also touched on Rotary’s efforts to eradicate polio and its use of international funds, noting an upcoming donor evening to further these initiatives.

The event underscored Rotary Club Bitola’s 25 years of service and its ongoing dedication to improving lives, both in the local community and beyond, as it looks forward to the next chapter of its journey.
