# Our fight against polio

The Rotary Club of Bitola is proud to participate in Rotary International's global effort to eradicate polio. Our members organize annual fundraising events including charity dinners, auctions, and community walks to support the End Polio Now campaign. These initiatives not only raise crucial funds but also increase awareness about the importance of vaccination and the ongoing battle against this debilitating disease.

In collaboration with local businesses and other community organizations, our club has implemented a matching donation program where each dollar raised is tripled through partnerships with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. This multiplication of resources has enabled us to make a significant impact despite our size. Last year alone, our club contributed enough to protect over 1,000 children from polio.

The fight against polio represents one of Rotary's longest-standing and most successful humanitarian commitments. Since Rotary and its partners launched the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in 1988, cases have decreased by 99.9%, preventing paralysis in an estimated 20 million people. Our club remains dedicated to continuing this vital work until polio is completely eradicated worldwide.
