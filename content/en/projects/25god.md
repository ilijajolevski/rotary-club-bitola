# 25 years of Rotary Club Bitola

On March 31st, 2024, Rotary Club Bitola celebrated a significant milestone - 25 years since its reestablishment. The celebration was held at Hotel Epinal in Bitola, bringing together current members, charter members, and numerous guests from other Rotary Clubs across Macedonia and the region. The event was particularly honored by the presence of several charter members who were part of the club's refounding in 1999.

The celebration was opened with a welcome speech by the current president, who reflected on the club's remarkable journey over the past quarter-century. During the formal part of the program, the club presented certificates of appreciation to individuals and organizations that have significantly contributed to the club's activities and humanitarian efforts throughout these years. The certificate recipients included both long-standing members who have dedicated decades to the club's mission and external partners who have supported various humanitarian initiatives.

Over its 25-year history, Rotary Club Bitola has implemented numerous humanitarian projects, focusing particularly on healthcare, education, and support for vulnerable groups in the Bitola region. These projects have made a substantial impact on the local community, improving infrastructure in schools and healthcare institutions, providing necessary equipment, and offering direct support to those in need. The club has consistently embodied the Rotary motto "Service Above Self" through its unwavering commitment to community service.

Looking toward the future, Rotary Club Bitola reaffirmed its dedication to continue its humanitarian mission with the same enthusiasm and commitment that has characterized its first 25 years. The celebration concluded with a social gathering that strengthened the bonds between members and reinforced the spirit of fellowship that is fundamental to the Rotary movement.
