# Restoration of a historic water fountain at the Officers Home

The Rotary Club Bitola successfully completed the restoration of the historic water fountain located at the Officers' Home (Oficerski) in Bitola. This project represents our club's commitment to preserving the rich cultural heritage of our city while enhancing public spaces for community use.

The fountain, which holds significant historical value for Bitola, had deteriorated over the years due to neglect and environmental factors. Our club undertook this restoration initiative as part of our mission to serve the community and maintain important cultural landmarks. The restoration work included cleaning the original stone structure, repairing damaged elements, restoring water functionality, and beautifying the surrounding area.

This project was made possible through the dedicated efforts of our club members and the generous support of local businesses and community partners. The restoration not only revitalized an important historical monument but also created a renewed gathering space for citizens and visitors alike. The newly restored fountain stands as a symbol of Bitola's rich history and the power of community service.

The official unveiling ceremony was attended by city officials, Rotary members, and community representatives, highlighting the collaborative spirit that made this project a success. The Rotary Club Bitola remains committed to identifying and undertaking projects that preserve our heritage while improving quality of life in our community.
